# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The ML Alpha MCP Integration project is designed to connect ML Alpha's APIs with large language models (LLMs) through an MCP server. The architecture includes:
- **MCP Server**: Acts as the intermediary between ML Alpha APIs and LLMs, providing tools for data interaction.
- **ML Alpha APIs**: Source of stock data, financial metrics, and SEC reports.
- **LLMs**: Consumers of MCP tools, enabling complex workflows and insights.

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **API Integration**: Use `api.mlalpha.com` as the endpoint for accessing ML Alpha data.
2. **Tool Design**: Develop MCP tools that are intuitive and efficient for LLMs to use.
3. **Workflow Optimization**: Focus on enabling seamless and scalable workflows for stock analysis.

## Design Patterns
- **Client-Server Model**: The MCP server acts as the client to ML Alpha APIs and the server to LLMs.
- **Modular Design**: Tools are designed as modular components to support diverse use cases.
- **Data Abstraction**: Abstract complex ML Alpha data into simplified formats for LLM consumption.

## Component Relationships
- **MCP Server**: Central component that interacts with both ML Alpha APIs and LLMs.
- **ML Alpha APIs**: Provide raw data for stock analysis.
- **LLMs**: Utilize MCP tools to process and analyze data.
