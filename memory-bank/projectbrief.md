# Project Brief

## Project Name
ML Alpha MCP Integration

## Overview
ML Alpha is a stock investment platform that leverages machine learning to identify winning stocks. It provides comprehensive stock-related data, including:
- Stock prices
- Financial metrics
- SEC reports (e.g., 10k, 10q)

The MCP server connects to ML Alpha's APIs (`api.mlalpha.com`) to provide tools for large language models (LLMs). These tools enable LLMs to interact with ML Alpha data and facilitate complex workflows.

## Core Goals
1. Integrate ML Alpha APIs with the MCP server.
2. Provide tools for LLMs to access and interact with ML Alpha data.
3. Enable complex workflows using ML Alpha data through LLMs.

## Scope
- Develop MCP tools for stock data retrieval, financial metrics, and SEC report access.
- Ensure seamless interaction between LLMs and ML Alpha APIs.
- Optimize workflows for stock analysis and investment decision-making.

## Target Users
- Developers working with LLMs.
- Financial analysts and investors leveraging ML Alpha data.
- Machine learning practitioners interested in stock market insights.

## Success Criteria
- Functional MCP tools for interacting with ML Alpha APIs.
- Efficient workflows for stock analysis using LLMs.
- Positive feedback from target users on usability and functionality.
