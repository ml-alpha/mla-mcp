# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The primary focus is on initializing the memory bank for the ML Alpha MCP Integration project. This involves creating core documentation files to establish a clear understanding of the project's scope, context, technologies, patterns, and progress.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's core requirements and goals.
- Created `productContext.md` to document the purpose, problems solved, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
1. Create `systemPatterns.md` to outline the system architecture, key technical decisions, and design patterns.
2. Create `techContext.md` to document the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, and dependencies.
3. Create `progress.md` to track the current status, known issues, and remaining tasks.

## Active Decisions
- Focus on documenting the memory bank files sequentially to ensure clarity and completeness.
- Use the information provided by the user to guide the content of each file.
